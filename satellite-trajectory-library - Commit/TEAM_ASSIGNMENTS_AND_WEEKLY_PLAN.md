# Team Assignments and Weekly Submission Plan

> Every member makes visible Git commits and contributes to the weekly report before the Monday of every week.

## 1. Team Responsibilities

| Member | Primary responsibility | Main files/modules | Individual evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Gilbert | Team lead, project integration, CMake, release coordination | `CMakeLists.txt`, `PROJECT_PLAN.md`, integration branches | Build logs, integration commits, merge coordination |

### Shared responsibilities

- **All members:** review at least one other member's code each week.
- **All members:** write and maintain tests for their own modules.
- **All members:** understand the complete project, not only their assigned method.
- **Gilbert:** does not own all code review; the lead coordinates integration and release readiness.
- **Erick:** owns the satellite demonstration but depends on Delvin, Ibrahim, and Jeremiah for vector, matrix, and RK support, also he is free to assign members to help him where necessary.

## 2. Working Rules

1. Create one feature branch per member, for example `feature/member-02-vector`.
2. Make small focused commits; do not wait until the end of the week.
3. Use commit messages such as `feat: add vector norm` or `test: cover singular matrix case`.
4. Open a pull request for significant changes.
5. A module is not considered complete until its tests pass and another member reviews it.
6. Do not silently change another member's public API; discuss changes first.
7. Record blockers in the weekly report before the Monday checkpoint.
8. Keep the README and final report in the group's own words, as required by the instructions.

## 3. Weekly Submission Calendar

The project timeline starts on Sunday, October 4, 2026. Weekly work is submitted before each Monday checkpoint.

| Week - Submission checkpoint - Main objective - Required team submission |

| Week 1 | Before Mon, Oct 5 | Confirm design and ownership | Architecture decision, branch setup, interface review, individual plans |
| Week 2 | Before Mon, Oct 12 | Complete foundations and direct solvers | Vector, Matrix, Gaussian elimination, determinant, inverse, first tests |
| Week 3 | Before Mon, Oct 19 | Complete decompositions and iterative methods | LU, Cholesky, QR, Gram-Schmidt, Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel, power iteration |
| Week 4 | Before Mon, Oct 26 | Complete interpolation, integration, fitting, and eigenvalues | All remaining general numerical methods with tests |
| Week 5 | Before Mon, Nov 2 | Integrate satellite application and stabilize library | RK2/RK4 trajectory propagation, examples, full test run, documentation draft |
| Final | Thu, Nov 5 | Submit and present complete project | Final source package, reports, final README, AI declaration, GitHub repository |

## AI usage:
We used AI to create an orgainised plan after we assigned and also made a rough work for this plan.
